Sample_work repository contains R/Python scripts developed from my previous employment.

**Search_interest_template.R (R studio)**
- This script produces a report that shows search volume trend by fuel type and vehicle category (SUV, Car, Truck)
<br>
- By linking to Google Analytics API, creates a custom report across 4 views (Desktop, Mobile Web, iOS, and Android)
- Then categorizes each vehicle by fuel type and vehicle category based on brand and model name

**Cross_search_template.R (R studio)**
- This script produces a report that shows cross-search behavior of consumers who search for a particular model
- For example, this report shows models searched by users who search for Ford F-150

**audi_content_campaign_ETL.R (R studio)**
- This script facilitates ETL of Google Analytics data for custom content page performance analysis
